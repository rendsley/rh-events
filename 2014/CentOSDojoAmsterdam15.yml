  The CentOS Dojos are a one day event, organised around 
  the world, that bring together people from the CentOS 
  Communities to talk about systems administration, best 
  practices in Linux-centric activities, and emerging 
  technologies. The emphasis is to find local speakers and 
  instructors to come together and talk about things that 
  they care about most, and to share stories from their 
  experiences working with CentOS in various scenarios. 
  Seating is limited so register [now](http://www.meetup.com/centos-netherlands).
